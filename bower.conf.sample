# This configuration file belongs in ~/.config/bower/bower.conf
# The lines beginning with '#' or ';' are treated as comment lines.

# The commands in the [command] section use shell-style quoting rules.
#
# - within single quotes, all characters represent themselves
# - within double quotes, all characters represent themselves except for
#   backslash which escapes the next character
# - outside of quotes, backslash escapes the next character
# - no escape sequences are supported, i.e. "\n" is the same as "n".
#
# If the first word of a command contains the unquoted and unescaped
# string "ssh" then an additional level of shell quoting will be applied
# to any arguments that bower adds to the command.

# ControlMaster option, and also set ControlPersist to greater than 60
# seconds (the polling period in the index view).

# The command should understand the "-t" option, to read recipients
# from the message headers itself.
